# DrawWithPhoneMovement
A Meta Spark filter project template that allows you to draw in 3D space by moving your phone around the room. Tap the screen to start/ stop movement. Includes a slider to scale the size of your line. Created using a particle system and plane tracker. Includes a basic material.

Please note: The demo video here illustrates the movement/ mechanism. I couldn't include the lovely glassy texture patch in this file as it didn't belong to me - it was created by Mate Steinforth - back in 2019. If you want a similar effect, you could try adding my new glass shader to the material - it's in my github in a seperate repository.
